        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Carbon Credit System is designed to encourage industries to offset their carbon emissions by supporting farmers 
            who plant trees. This initiative promotes environmental sustainability and provides financial benefits to farmers.

    <section class="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            - Farmers plant trees and submit proof of plantation.<br>
            - Government officers verify the proof and issue carbon credits.<br>
            - Industries can purchase carbon credits from farmers to compensate for their emissions.<br>
            - Transactions are securely handled using Ethereum-based payments.

        <h2>What is a Carbon Credit?</h2>
        <p>
            A carbon credit is a certificate representing one metric ton of CO₂ removed from the atmosphere. 
            Businesses and individuals can purchase these credits to compensate for their emissions, 
            supporting sustainability initiatives like tree planting.
